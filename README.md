RUNNING
--------
The config file is in /resources/config. 

It works much in the same way as sgminer.  


Settings can be passed along to the miner on startup, such as with a .bat file.

They will replace settings in the config file. 

For Example:

setx GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 1
SKMiner.exe --connections 127.0.0.1:9325 user x password x --algorithm sk1024_djm

These are the only settings required to start the miner, the config file is no longer necessary.
Of course this will put you on the lowest settings and cause poor performance.

BUILDING
---------

You will need these libraries to build from source:

jansson 2.7, boost 1.56.0, OpenSSL

You will also need the AMD ADL files. See the readme.txt in /source/ADL_SDK


Windows users can build from source right now, providing you have the libraries. I built using VS2013.


Linux users may have difficulty building from source currently. I'm working on making the source fully Linux Compatible.
